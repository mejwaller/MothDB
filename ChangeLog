29/10/06 - M. Waller - Began initial setup of code structure. Added main.cpp,
/MainWin/MainWindow.cpp and /MainWin/MainWindow.hpp (for library libMainWin.a).
Added configure.ac, and Makefile.ams in root, /src and /src/MainWin.
Also aded utility script 'autotools.sh' to perform aclocal, configure and
automake -a

13/11/06 - M. Waller - Added menua bar and filemenu with open, new and exit
entries. Connected exit entry - not open or new. Mainwindow construction via 
init not exception safe - can change to use RIAI to make it thus.

20/11/06 - M. Waller - Implemented boost::shared_ptr to make constructor
exception safe when creating children of mainwindow

21/11/06 - M. Waller - Added slot for creating new dockwidget

3/12/06 - M. Waller - Implemented first prototype for slot that creates new
dockwidget.  Implemented first prototype for slot that opens existing file.

29/01/07 - M. Waller - child objects are 'owned' by parent objects in qt model,
so disabled shared_ptr implementation (caused seg fault on exit). Changed to use
'simple' mdi for child windows as dock widget window implementation unsatisfactory

01/02/07 - M. Waller - started adding save functionality. Now file open not
working properly (silly min-scrollbar window opens instead of normal QTextEdit.

10/02/07 - Added save functionality, corrected file opening issue alluded to in enrty
for 01/02/07

15/02/07 - allowed mulitple file open at once, implemented save last open file path (so file
open dialog reopens at last dir used to open a file)

22/02/07 - Implemented first attempt withdefault syntax highlighting plagiarised from qt
example

27/2/07 - Small modifications of syntax highlighting - added all c++ keywords
and added (all?) preporcessor # directives

12/03/07 - implemented file | saveAll

13/03/07 - implemented undo (via ctrl-z) - redo not working (used Qt's QTextEdit methods -
redo (via ctrl-y) not working I don't understand

22/03/07 - added edit menu and added placeholders for edit|find and edit|gotoline num

20/5/07 - added ability to load files from command line (for association etc)
